# CS155 Final: Simple Calculator

This project is a simple calculator that performs arithmetic calculations for numbers between 0-9. 
You are able to add, subtract, divide and multiply two integers.

## Usage

Download the .asm file and load into the LC3 Tools program.
The latest version of LC3Tools for all platforms can be found at: 
https://github.com/chiragsakhuja/lc3tools/releases

Once you have the .asm file, open up the LC3Tools application and click the folder button.
The folder button is circled in red. This button will be around the top left of your program window.

Once you have loaded the assembly code into the program, click the wrench button to create a object file. The object file is used by the program to run the calculator code. This button will be around the top left of your program window.

The second to last thing to get the program running, is to click the Simulator button. This button looks like a microchip and is located at the top right of your program window.

The last button you need to press before the program starts is the play button. One you click this, the program will start. If you want to restart the program, pause the program and click the button below the play button which looks like a redo button. After that just click the play button again and the program will start again!

From there on, just follow what the console asks you to do and there you have it! You can try out as many different calculations as you want!
